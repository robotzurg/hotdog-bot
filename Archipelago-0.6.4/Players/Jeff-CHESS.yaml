# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.

    # Single: Your opponent starts with an army of 7 pieces and 8 pawns. You have a king. Finding checkmate is your goal.
    # To get there, find checks, mate!

    # Ordered Progressive: When you deliver checkmate, you instead graduate to a Super-Sized board. Your goal is to
    # checkmate again, on that board!
    # 
    # Progressive: As Ordered Progressive, but the board grows larger when someone sends you your Super-Sized board.

    # have about an extra Bishop and an extra Pawn for Checkmate Maxima to be considered in logic.
    # 
    # Bullet: All checks are relaxed. Material expectations are raised, so the player will have more material earlier. You
    # will have about an extra Rook and an extra Bishop for Checkmate Maxima to be considered in logic.
    # 
    # Relaxed: Most checks require almost twice as much material, so the player will have overwhelming forces. You will

    # a Cannon, and a Vao.

    # Camel: Adds a custom army themed after 3,x leapers like the Camel (3,1) and Tribbabah (3,0). (The Knight is a 2,1
    # leaper.)
    # 
    # Petal: Adds a custom army themed after pieces that move down angled paths. The Gardener is a 2,2 leaper with
    # additional pacifist moves. The Ribbon moves 1 space as a Bishop before rotating to move 2 more spaces. The Petal
    # moves 3 spaces as a Rook before rotating 3 more spaces. The Miracle moves as a Ribbon and as a Petal.
