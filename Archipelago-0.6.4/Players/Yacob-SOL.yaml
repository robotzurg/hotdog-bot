Nine Sols:
  # Generic Archipelago options. These are documented at
  # https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en#universal-game-options

  # Many of these generic options accept "item name groups" and "location name groups".
  # For example: start_hints: ["Sol Seals"] or exclude_locations: ["Prison", "FMR"]
  # or priority_locations: ["Sol Fight Rewards"]

  # See the bottom of this file for complete lists of Nine Sols' item/location name groups.

    # Allows the Sol Seal items to be placed on any location in the multiworld, instead of their vanilla locations.
    'false': 0
    'true': 50

  seals_for_eigong:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed to open the door in Central Hall to New Kunlun Control Hub, fight Eigong,
    # and complete the goal.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, you don't need to visit Tiandao Research Center or trigger the "point of no return".
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 8

    random: 0
    random-low: 0
    random-high: 0

  seals_for_prison:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed for Jiequan to appear in Factory (Great Hall), allowing you to "fight" him,
    # do the whole Prison escape sequence, and check most of the locations in Factory (Machine Room).
    # Note that you also need Mystic Nymph: Scout Mode before Jiequan will appear,
    # since you can't do the Prison escape sequence without it.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, the real Jiequan fight may be done before or after Prison, and it does not matter
    # which Sol Seals you've collected, only the total number.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 8
    3: 50
    random: 0
    random-low: 0
    random-high: 0

  seals_for_ethereal:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed for the entrance to Lady Ethereal's soulscape to appear in Cortex Center.
    # See also the skip_soulscape_platforming option.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, it does not matter which Sol Seals you've collected, only the total number.
    # The maximum is 7 instead of 8 because 8 would be incompatible with shuffle_sol_seals: false.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 7
    4: 50
    random: 0
    random-low: 0
    random-high: 0

  skip_soulscape_platforming:
    # After you collect enough Sol Seals to unlock Lady Ethereal's soulscape (see seals_for_ethereal),
    # if this option is enabled, Cortex Center will skip ahead to the state where you can enter her boss fight,
    # instead of the long platforming sequence you normally do first.
    # 
    # This is a .yaml/generation option because it has a small effect on logic: The platforming sequence logically
    # requires Tai-Chi Kick, so skipping it allows the Lady Ethereal fight to be in-logic with only Air Dash.
    'false': 50
    'true': 0

  randomize_jade_costs:
    # Edit the cost of every jade in this slot to a randomly chosen number between jade_cost_min and jade_cost_max.
    # 
    # This includes jades which are not Archipelago items.
    # 
    # As a reminder: you start the game with 2 units of computing power, and there are 8 Computing Unit items to find,
    # for a maximum power of 10.
    'false': 50
    'true': 0

  jade_cost_min:
    # The minimum possible jade cost. Has no effect if randomize_jade_costs is false.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 10
    1: 50
    random: 0
    random-low: 0
    random-high: 0

  jade_cost_max:
    # The maximum possible jade cost. Has no effect if randomize_jade_costs is false.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 10
    3: 50
    random: 0
    random-low: 0
    random-high: 0

  jade_cost_plando:
    # Manually specify the cost of certain jades. For example: { "Stasis Jade": 0, "Steely Jade": 10 }
    # 
    # The costs may be any integer from 0 to 10, even if jade_cost_min and jade_cost_max are set to a narrower range.
    {}

  first_root_node:
    # The first root node you can teleport to from Four Seasons Pavilion after starting a randomized game.
    # This is often referred to as your "spawn", although you technically always spawn in FSP.
    # 
    # Many root nodes are intentionally excluded from this list, usually because if you started there
    # no locations would be checkable at the start of the game when you have no items yet.
    # 
    # Some first_root_nodes will force items to be placed early, since the randomizer would be unbeatable otherwise:
    # - galactic_dock early-places one of Nymph or Tai-Chi Kick
    # - central_transport_hub early-places Tai-Chi Kick
    # - factory_underground early-places one of Air Dash or Cloud Leap
    # - inner_warehouse early-places Wall Climb and one of Cloud Leap, Air Dash or Ledge Grab
    # - power_reservoir_west early-places one of Cloud Leap, Air Dash or Tai-Chi Kick
    # See the descriptions of shuffle_grapple, shuffle_wall_climb and shuffle_ledge_grab for additional cases.
