# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.

# Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files.

    # - Rolling onto the wall from the upper right platform in Lockstone East Upper after making it go up to get into East Upper Keyed Door without the lever
    # - When coming from the Old Watchtowers Barb Elevator, the lever to Ice Skating Start can be skipped by hooking over the gate from the ledge around the top of the elevator
    # - In Overgrown Ruins, access the Soul Orb in Lower that requires Hookshot by rolling onto the wall above and falling down. Standalone randomizer notes that this roll may require Haste (rolling stat) >=2.

    # If you remove Weapons from randomization, your starting weapon will be forced to be the Reaper's Sword (default weapon).
    # If you remove Shiny Things from randomization, Rusty Belltower Key will still be added to the pool for day/night access.
    # If you combine this option with plando not from pool, you are very likely to encounter generation errors.
    # The fewer pools randomized, the more likely you are to encounter generation errors.
