# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.
name: Player{number}

# Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files.

  progression_balancing:
    # A system that can move progression earlier, to try and prevent the player from getting stuck and bored early.
    # 
    # A lower setting means more getting stuck. A higher setting means less getting stuck.

    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0

  accessibility:
    # Set rules for reachability of your items/locations.
    # 
    # **Full:** ensure everything can be reached and acquired.
    # 
    # **Minimal:** ensure what is needed to reach your goal can be acquired.

  location_balancing:
    # Location balancing affects the density of progression items found in your world relative to other worlds. This setting changes nothing for solo games.
    # 
    # - Disabled: Location density in your world can fluctuate greatly depending on the settings of other players. In extreme cases, your world may be entirely populated with filler items
    # 
    # - Compromise: Locations are balanced to a midpoint between "fair" and "natural"
    # 
    # - Full: Locations are balanced in an attempt to make the number of progression items sent out and received equal over the entire game

    # - Death Only: A DeathLink broadcast will be sent every time a chef falls into a stage hazard. All local chefs will be killed when any one perishes.
